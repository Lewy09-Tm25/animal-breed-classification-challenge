# Animal breed AI Classification Challenge
#### This project focuses on the classification of different breeds of dogs and cats, by their images. There are a total of 37 breeds of dogs and cats, and by using the concept of Transfer Learning, Inception V3 is used to classify the image.
*Since this project was a part of a bigger challenge organized on Dockship.io, the dataset cannot be distributed publicly.
